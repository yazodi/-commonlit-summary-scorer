PROJECT TITLE: CommonLit Student Summary Scorer (Kaggle NLP Project)

OBJECTIVE:
This project is an NLP-based scoring system that automatically evaluates the quality of student-written summaries. It is based on the Kaggle competition "CommonLit Evaluate Student Summaries."

Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlit-evaluate-student-summaries

---

DATA USED:
- summaries_train.csv → Training data (student summaries + scores)
- summaries_test.csv → Summaries to be scored
- sample_submission.csv → Sample submission format
- prompts_train.csv / prompts_test.csv → Additional metadata (not used in this project)

---

TARGET VARIABLES:
- content → Measures how well the summary captures the main idea (0–5 scale)
- wording → Measures clarity and expression quality (0–5 scale)

---

STEPS IMPLEMENTED:

1. DATA EXPLORATION
   - Loaded and analyzed `summaries_train.csv`
   - Focused on `text`, `content`, and `wording` columns

2. TEXT PROCESSING & MODELING
   - Used `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text into numerical features
   - Applied Ridge Regression inside a `MultiOutputRegressor`
   - Model trained to predict both scores simultaneously
   - Validation RMSE: **0.6819**

3. PREDICTION & KAGGLE SUBMISSION
   - Generated predictions on `summaries_test.csv`
   - Filled predictions into the `sample_submission.csv` structure
   - Created `submission.csv` for competition upload

4. STREAMLIT WEB APP (`app.py`)
   - Developed a user-friendly web interface to input any summary
   - Displays instant predictions for `content` and `wording` scores
   - Exported model and vectorizer as `.pkl` files using `joblib`
   - Deployed publicly using Hugging Face Spaces

TEST EXAMPLES:

[Weak Summary]
It was about a story. It was good. The people were talking and then something happened.  
Expected Score: Content ≈ 1.0, Wording ≈ 1.0

[Intermediate Summary]
The article discusses the importance of environmental protection. It explains how pollution harms the earth and suggests ways to stop it.  
Expected Score: Content ≈ 3.0, Wording ≈ 3.0

[Advanced Summary]
The summary articulates the author’s argument that environmental degradation is a result of unchecked industrial expansion. It effectively highlights key solutions such as policy reform, corporate accountability, and individual action to mitigate ecological damage.  
Expected Score: Content ≈ 4.5, Wording ≈ 4.5

HOW TO RUN:
1. Use `streamlit run app.py` for local testing
2. Alternatively, access the deployed version via Hugging Face Spaces
3. Model files: `ridge_model.pkl`, `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
